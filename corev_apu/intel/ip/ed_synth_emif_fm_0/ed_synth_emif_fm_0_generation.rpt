Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0: SPD Bytes must be set for RDIMM/LRDIMM and are unique to each memory module. Please check with the SPD provider to ensure correct SPD data.
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0: When ECC is enabled, a partial write using the DM pins triggers a read-modify-write operation.  Frequent partial writes can lead to poor efficiency.
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0.arch: EMIF IP requires EMIF Calibration IP to source its calbus clock and calbus conduit.
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0.arch: PHY and controller running at 2x the frequency of user logic for improved efficiency.
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0.arch: Placement of address/command pins must follow "DDR4 Scheme 1A: Component and DIMM (with A17)".
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0.arch: Interface estimated to require 2 I/O Bank(s) and 4 I/O PLL(s). This is only an estimation. Final usage depends on user pin location assignments and/or fitter behavior.
